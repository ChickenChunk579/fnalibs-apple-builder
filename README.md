# fnalibs ios builder
Convenient download and build scripts for FNA's iOS / tvOS native libraries.

Run `./updatelibs` to automatically clone or pull all the fnalibs. When cloning the repos, it also applies an FNA-specific patch for SDL2.

Run `./buildlibs [ios/ios-sim/ios-fat/tvos/tvos-sim/tvos-fat/all]` to build all libraries for the selected platform. It will place the resulting archives into a `release/` directory.
Note that building "*-fat" creates the combined archive as well as the individual simulator and device builds.

Run `./buildlibs clean` to remove all auto-generated build directories.

## dependencies

Requires `git` and `hg` available from the terminal.
